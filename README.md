# FirstOrderLogic
This is an inference system to determine if a query can be inferred from a given knowledge base. This project implements a parser, to read through the sentences stated in KB and converts them to First Order Logic sentences. Based on the converted sentences it checks whether the query can be inferred from the knowledge base. Python was used to implement this, and it is based on Backward Chaining algorithm.
